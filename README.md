# Summary
This app will allow users to input a snippet of song lyrics and find the top 10 songs, sorted by popularity, that contain the song lyric. The matching songs are displayed with a link to a YouTube video of the song.

# Motivation
This app was built with this common problem in mind: what is the title of that song that I'm constantly singing in my head?
The app is meant to allow users to input that nagging song lyric into the search bar and have their question promptly answered.
